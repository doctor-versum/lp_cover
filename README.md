# lp_cover â€“ A Free Time Project  

lp_cover is a free time project of mine, that I will **NOT** be updating actively. There is no guarantee that I will be adding new features or fixing existing bugs.  

## About the Project  

This is a small project I created because my **Launchpad** looked kind of boring sitting in the corner of my desk. To make it more visually interesting, I developed this program, which features **music synchronization** and a **basic idle animation** that plays when no sound is detected.  

## Features  

- **Music Sync:** The Launchpad reacts to audio input and displays effects accordingly.  
- **Idle Animation:** When no music is playing, a simple animation runs to keep the Launchpad from looking static.  
- **Lightweight:** The program is minimalistic and doesn't require complex setup.  

## Installation & Usage  

You need [lp_cover.py](https://github.com/doctor-versum/lp_cover/blob/main/lp_cover.py) and [venv/](https://github.com/doctor-versum/lp_cover/tree/main/venv) for the program to work. Then run start.bat. I will be adding a pyinstaller exe later on. Stay tuned for updates!  

## Demonstration

## Limitations & Future Updates  

Since this is a side project, I **do not** guarantee future updates, bug fixes, or new features. However, feedback and suggestions are always welcome! It currently only supports the Novation Launchpad Mini Mk3. It might work on other models, especially if you modify the code, but I can't guarantee it for most of them.

## Contribution
